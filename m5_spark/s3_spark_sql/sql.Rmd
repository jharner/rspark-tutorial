```

Load `sparklyr` and establish the Spark connection.
```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(sparklyr)

# start the sparklyr session locally or to the master container
if(system("test \"/bin/spark-class/\" && echo 1 || echo 0") == 1) {
  master <- "spark://master:7077"
} else{
  master <- "local"
}
sc <- spark_connect(master = master)
```

## 5.3 Spark DataFrame SQL

`sparklyr` can import a wide range of data directly into Spark from an external data source, e.g., json. In addition, it is possible to query Spark DataFrames directly.

We will be using the `nycflights13` data again. The `flights` and `airlines` R data frames are copied into Spark.
```{r}
library(nycflights13)
flights_sdf <- copy_to(sc, flights, "flights",  overwrite = TRUE)
airlines_sdf <- copy_to(sc, airlines, "airlines", overwrite = TRUE)
```

### 5.3.1 Joining Spark Data Tables

In Section 5.2.1 the `dplyr` verbs were used to manipulate a Spark DataFrame. However, we often have multiple related Spark SQL tables which we need to combine prior to performing data manipulations.

A workflow was developed in Section 5.2.1 to find the flights with a departure delay greater than 1000 minutes. However, we did not have the carrier names since they were in a different table. Providing this information can be done with a `left_join`.
```{r}
flights_sdf %>%
  left_join(airlines_sdf, by = "carrier") %>%
  select(carrier, name, flight, year:day, arr_delay, dep_delay) %>%
  filter(dep_delay > 1000) %>%
  arrange(desc(dep_delay))
```
Notice that three of the top five largest delays were associated with Envoy Air, which was not obvious based on the two-letter abbreviation.

`dplyr` has various verbs that combine two tables. If this is not adequate, then the joins, or other operations, must be done in the database prior to importing the data into Spark

### 5.3.2 Querying a Spark DataFrame

It is also possible to use Spark DataFrames as tables in a "database" using the Spark SQL interface, which forms the basis of Spark DataFrames.

The `spark_connect` object implements a DBI interface for Spark, which allows you to use `dbGetQuery` to execute SQL commands. The returned result is an R data frame.

We now show that the above workflow can be done in R except that R data frames are used.
```{r}
library(DBI)
flights_df <- dbGetQuery(sc, "SELECT * FROM flights")
airlines_df <- dbGetQuery(sc, "SELECT * FROM airlines")
flights_df %>%
  left_join(airlines_df, by = "carrier") %>%
  select(carrier, name, flight, year:day, arr_delay, dep_delay) %>%
  filter(dep_delay > 1000) %>%
  arrange(desc(dep_delay))
```

Of course, this assumes the Spark DataFrames can be imported into R, i.e., they must fit into local memory.

The `by` argument in the `left_join` is not needed if there is a single variable common to both tables. Alternately, we could use `by = c("carrier", "carrier")`, where the names could be different if they represent the same variable.

### 5.3.3 Sampling

We can sample random rows of a Spark DataFrame using:  

* `sample_n` for a fixed number;  
* `sample_frac` for a fixed fraction.

```{r}
sample_n(flights_sdf, 10)
sample_frac(flights_sdf, 0.01)
```
Sampling is often done during the development and testing cycle to limit the size of the data.

### 5.3.4 Writing Data to HDFS

We can save the results of our analysis or the tables that you have generated in Spark into HDFS persistent storage. Parquet is a commonly used persistent store for various data processing systems in the Hadoop ecosystem. It has a columnar storage format which Spark SQL supports for both reading and writing, including the schema of the original data.

As an example, we can write the `airlines_sdf` Spark DataFrame out to a Parquet file using the `spark_write_parquet` function.
```{r}
library(rhdfs)
hdfs.init()
spark_write_parquet(airlines_sdf,
                  path = "hdfs://hadoop:9000/user/rstudio/airlines_parquet",
                  mode = "overwrite")
hdfs.ls("/user/rstudio")
```
This writes the Spark DataFrame to the given HDFS path and names the Parquet file `airlines_parquet`.

You can use the `spark_read_parquet` function to read the same table back into a subsequent Spark session:
```{r}
spark_read_parquet(sc, "airlines2_sdf",
                   "hdfs://hadoop:9000/user/rstudio/airlines_parquet")
```

Note that `airlines2_sdf` is a Spark DataFrame. Use the `spark_write_csv` and `spark_write_json` functions among others to write data to HDFS as `csv` or `json` files, respectively. 

### 5.3.5 Hive Functions

Many of Hive’s built-in functions (UDF) and built-in aggregate functions (UDAF) can be called by `dplyr`’s `mutate` and `summarize` funcitons.

`datediff` and `current_date` are Hive UDFs to figure the difference between the `flight_date` and the current system date:
```{r}
flights_sdf %>% 
  mutate(flight_date = paste(year, month, day, sep="-"),
         days_since = datediff(current_date(), flight_date)) %>%
  group_by(flight_date, days_since) %>%
  tally() %>%
  arrange(days_since)
```

```{r}
spark_disconnect(sc)
```
