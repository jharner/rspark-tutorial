## 1.4 Version Control with git

We will use Git as a version control system (VCS). Git is a distributed version control system invented by Linus Torvalds for developing the Linux Kernel. Git allows you to track changes to files over time.

Why should you use Git? Git allows you to:  

* undue changes;  
* look at the history of the files in a repository;  
* check out a previous version;  
* document changes made to the files;  
* create branches for experimenting.

We will use the RStudio's builtin `git`, but you should also install `git` on your local computer. You will need to activate `git` within RStudio if it is not already available. Go to `Global Options...` from the `Tools` menu, select Git/SVN from the side panel, and click "Enable version control interface for RStudio projects" and enter the Git executable as `/usr/bin/git` if these are not already specified. You do not need to specify a SSH RSA Key since we will not be using `ssh`.
